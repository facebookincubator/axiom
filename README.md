## Advance Velox Version
Axiom integrates Velox as a Git submodule, referencing a specific commit of the Velox repository. Advance Velox when your changes depend on code in Velox that is not available in the current commit. To update the Velox version, follow these steps:
* `git -C velox checkout main`
* `git -C velox pull`
* `git add velox`
* Build and run tests to ensure everything works.
* Submit a PR, get it approved and merged.
