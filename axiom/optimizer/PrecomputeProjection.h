/// Builder-style class to generate an optional ProjectOp node that computes
/// expressions needed by nodes that cannot evaluate expressions directly.
///
/// The only Velox plan nodes that can evaluate expressions directly are Filter
/// and Project. Other nodes require expressions precomputed. Some nodes allow
/// constant expressions.
///
/// Aggregation node requires grouping keys, aggregate masks and inputs to
/// aggregates precomputed. It allows constant expressions for inputs to
/// aggregates, but not for grouping keys or masks.
///
/// OrderBy node requires sorting keys precomputed.
///
/// HashJoin node requires join keys precomputed. It allows arbitrary
/// expressions for the extra filter.
///
/// Unnest node requires replicated and unnest columns precomputed.
///
/// In addition, Aggregation allows to specify output name for the aggregate
/// columns, but not for grouping keys. It projects grouping keys as is. Hence,
/// it may be necessary to add Project node before Aggregation to rename
/// grouping keys. For example, this would be the case for "SELECT k as key,
/// count(1) FROM t GROUP BY 1" query.
///
/// The basic usage of this class is the following:
///   - Create an instance by providing an input RelationOp and a DerivedTable
///   it comes from.
///   - Call toColumn(expr) or toColumns(exprs) for all expressions used in the
///   relation.
///   - Call maybeProject() to retrieve the new input RelationOp (either
///   original one or the one with ProjectOp on top).
///   - Re-write the relation to replace expressions with columns from the new
///   input.
///
/// By default, all input columns are projected out alongside new expressions.
/// To project only necessary columns, set 'projectAllInputs' to false in the
/// ctor. (Used for Unnest and Aggregation.)
///
/// By default, all non-column expressions are replaced with projections. To
/// preserve both column and literal expressions, set 'preserveLiterals' to true
/// when calling toColumn(s). (Used for Aggregation.)
///
/// toColumn(s) methods take an optional 'alias(es)' parameter to specify that
/// the expression must be accessible with a particular name. This is needed to
/// ensure that grouping keys projected out of an Aggregation have specific
/// names. (TODO: Extend AggregationNode in Velox to allow specifying output
/// names for grouping keys.)
class PrecomputeProjection {
 public:
  /// @param input Input relation.
  /// @param dt DerivedTable the relations belong to. Used to specify DT for
